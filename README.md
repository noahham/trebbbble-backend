# Trebbbble but it's just the backend

## Requirements

1. ACRCloud's API keys (currently established as environment variables).
2. All other dependencies found in `requirements.txt`.

## How to steal my code

1. Aquire the API keys and declare them as variables in main.py (maybe in a txt file?).
2. Replace all calls that have os.environ.get('key_name') with your variable names.
3. You also need to get some cookies data (just a really long string) to download the video without getting banned.
